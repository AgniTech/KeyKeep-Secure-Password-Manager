# MongoDB Setup Guide for KeyKeep

## Issues Fixed

I've identified and fixed several critical issues that were preventing data from saving to MongoDB:

### 1. Server Configuration Issues
- **Fixed**: Mixed import/require syntax in `backend/server.js`
- **Fixed**: Missing dependencies in `backend/package.json`
- **Fixed**: Incorrect file path references

### 2. Database Connection Issues
- **Fixed**: Environment variable naming inconsistency (`MONGODB_URI` vs `MONGO_URI`)
- **Fixed**: Improved error handling in database connection
- **Fixed**: Added proper logging for debugging

### 3. API Improvements
- **Enhanced**: Vault save API with better error handling and validation
- **Fixed**: Registration API to return JWT token as expected by frontend
- **Fixed**: Response format consistency between login/register APIs

## Environment Setup

### 1. Create Environment File
Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/keykeep?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT Secret for authentication tokens (minimum 32 characters)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here-minimum-32-characters-long

# Encryption Key for vault data (64 hex characters = 32 bytes)
# Generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-64-character-hex-encryption-key-here-32-bytes-exactly

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 2. MongoDB Atlas Setup
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Create a free cluster
3. Create a database user with read/write permissions
4. Whitelist your IP address (or 0.0.0.0/0 for development)
5. Get your connection string and replace in the `.env` file

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install main dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 4. Start the Application
```bash
# Option 1: Start backend server
cd backend
npm start

# Option 2: If using Vercel development
vercel dev
```

## Key Changes Made

### Database Schema
- Added timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) to Vault model
- Improved error handling in all API endpoints

### API Endpoints
- `/api/auth/login` - Enhanced with better error messages
- `/api/auth/register` - Now returns JWT token for immediate login
- `/api/vault/save` - Improved validation and error handling
- `/api/vault/fetch` - Ready for fetching user vault data

### Security
- Proper JWT token validation
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Testing the Fix

1. **Registration**: Try creating a new account - should redirect to vault
2. **Login**: Test with existing credentials
3. **Save Credential**: Add a new password entry - check console for success logs
4. **Database Check**: Verify entries are saved in MongoDB Atlas dashboard

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "MONGODB_URI is not defined"
**Solution**: Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root and contains the correct MongoDB URI.

### Issue: "JWT_SECRET not configured"
**Solution**: Add a JWT_SECRET to your `.env` file with at least 32 characters.

### Issue: "Network error during save"
**Solution**: Check that your backend server is running and MongoDB connection is established.

### Issue: Data not appearing in frontend
**Solution**: The frontend currently uses local storage simulation. The backend save is working, but you need to implement the fetch functionality to display saved data.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the vault fetch API to load saved credentials
2. Add proper encryption/decryption for stored passwords
3. Add validation for duplicate entries
4. Implement credential updating and deletion

The core saving issue has been resolved - your data should now be properly saved to MongoDB!
