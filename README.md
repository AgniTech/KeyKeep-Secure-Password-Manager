## ‚ú® Features

- **Client-Side Encryption**: All your credentials are encrypted and decrypted locally in your browser using **libsodium**, a modern and easy-to-use cryptographic library. Your master password is the key, and it's never sent to the server.
- **Secure User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication ensures that only you can access your vault. Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** before being stored.
- **Intuitive Vault Management**: Easily add, edit, delete, and search for your credentials. The interface is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to navigate.
- **Professional & Secure UI**: A redesigned user interface with a professional color palette, frosted glass effects, and a dark, tech-grid background.
- **Password Generator**: Create strong, random, and unique passwords with customizable length and character types.
- **Password Health Analysis**: Get a comprehensive overview of your password security with a health score, and identify weak, reused, or compromised passwords.
- **Profile Customization**: Personalize your profile by adding a name, date of birth, and a profile picture with upload, change, and remove functionalities.
- **Loading Animations**: Smooth loading animations provide a better user experience during page transitions and data operations.
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Your profile picture and settings are saved in local storage, ensuring they persist between sessions.
